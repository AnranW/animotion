<h2>What is Keynote?</h2>

<p>
	<b>Keynote</b> uses <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>,
	<a href="https://revealjs.com/">Reveal.js</a>
	and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> to create beautiful animated presentations
	with ease thanks to <a href="/docs/auto-animate">auto-animate</a> from Reveal.js.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to know Svelte but it's easy to learn and powerful if you want to learn a
	JavaScript framework â€” you can learn Svelte from the <a href="https://learn.svelte.dev/"
		>official Svelte tutorial.</a
	>
</p>

<p>
	You can use <b>Keynote</b> for making slides for presentations to creating educational content you
	can record and share with everyone.
</p>

<p>
	To make slides you use web technologies you know and love like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and include
	any JavaScript library to visualize what you want from using canvas to 3D.
</p>

<p>
	Also if you don't love Tailwind CSS you can write regular CSS but give it a chance because of the
	speed it gives you when making presentations.
